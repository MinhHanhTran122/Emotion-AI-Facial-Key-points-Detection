Emotion AI: Facial Key-points Detection with Deep Learning (Residual Convolutional Neural Network)

Introduction

In this project, we will build, train and test a Convolutional Neural Networks with Residual Blocks to predict facial key point coordinates from facial images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
Tracking faces in images and video
Analyzing facial expressions
Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
Biometrics / face recognition
